- add scraper for getpocket to download a users list of saved urls.

	$ pyscrapers version
	see how long it takes?
	Profile and reduce time.
- don't download the same content twice in terms of signature.
- do my own db for downloaded stuff.
- add a more flexible file save mechanism that will not fail
	if the file names already exist.

- the current instagram downloader does not download videos
	It does download images for the videos.
	It currently download number of images = number of user
	posts + 1 (the main image of the user).
	So it downloads the images for the videos just not the
	videos themselves.
	fix this.
- add flag to control whether or not we add cookies from firefox
	or google or not at all.
	(default should be firefox).
- do website for this project and publish to github.
